    <h3>  Introduction </h3>
      <p>
        How do we keep all of our HTML in the right places? By making sure we build the structure correctly from the very first line. Let's construct an entire HTML document to practice putting the necessary elements where they belong.

      <p>
        Every HTML document requires a few specific tags that enable your browser to correctly interpret and display the content. A good way to think about this is that we need to build a solid structure for the content we want to put in our page, and each tag has a function in building that structure. If we forget a tag, our structure will weaken and the browser might not be able to display our page at all. So it's important we put every piece in its place at the beginning.

        To get started, open index.html in your text editor.

        While working through these assignments, your general workflow should center on writing code in the text editor and periodically running learn in the terminal to check your work.

        Another great way to track your progress is to open up the HTML document in your browser and watch how each change you make in the text editor affects the visual layout in the browser. For reference, here's a guide to

          Once you have the HTML document open in your browser, you can make changes to it in the text editor, save the file, refresh the page in the browser, and see the changes instantly.

      <h3> Conclusion  </h3>
      
      <p>
        We've figured out how to construct a solid structure for the HTML document. Now, as you pick up new HTML tags, you'll be able to add more elements to build out the rest of the page.
